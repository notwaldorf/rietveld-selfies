rietveld-selfies
==============

Are you a Chromium developer? Add selfies to your pull requests and comments on Rietveld!

This is just like [github selfies](https://github.com/thieman/github-selfies) but for the Chromium [code review](https://codereview.chromium.org/) tool.

## How to make it go
This isn't in the Chrome Web Store yet, so you need to load this the long way. Clone the repo, go to `chrome://settings`, flip the `Developer mode` checkbox and load the unpacked extension (the entire `rietveld-selfies` folder). If everything goes well, it should end up looking like this:
![an extension!](http://i.imgur.com/1xaTDl6.png)

## A wild selfie appears!
In Rietveld, the `Publish and mail comments` page should look like this:
![selfie!](http://i.imgur.com/odjGz3F.png)

The selfie -> imgur processing elves are not the fastest, so wait until the `[[selfie-placeholder-0]]` placeholder has been replaced with the proper `imgur` link. That's it, you're done!
